## About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm **Erik Dervishi**, a Computer Science student at the University of Bologna with over 3 years of experience in C++ and Python. I specialize in developing high-performance software solutions, optimizing algorithms, and building AI systems.

### My Expertise
I have a proven track record of working on a variety of projects, including:
- **Open-source contributions**: Optimized internal algorithms in CXXGraph, an alternative to Boost Graph Library, improving traversal speed by 15%.
- **Text Editor Development**: Created a high-performance text editor called `mvim`, inspired by Vim, using C++ and ncurses to reduce memory usage by 25%.
- **AI Systems**: Developed an AI for ConnectX with a 95% win rate, leveraging Alpha-beta pruning for decision-making optimization.
- **Operating Systems**: Implemented a custom operating system on ÂµMPS3, focusing on process scheduling and kernel space management, improving system efficiency by 20%.

### Technical Skills
- **Languages**: C++, Python, JavaScript, Java
- **Frameworks**: React, NextJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, CMake, Linux, ncurses, Unreal Engine, Blueprints

Through my projects, I aim to continuously push the boundaries of software performance and artificial intelligence while working with diverse technologies. Feel free to explore the [Projects](./projects) section to see more of my work.
